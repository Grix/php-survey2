This is a simple survey engine using PHP and MySQL. You can create surveys, and results will be stored in a database and the results can be viewed afterwards.
 
This is made mostly for fun. Do whatever you'd like with it. Don't be surprised if you find really shitty code, I barely know PHP/MySQL.



INSTALLATION:

Extract to web server. 
Configure your mysql server (not included).
Configure include/settings.php. 
Also configure include/filenames.php if you do any changes to filenames or directories. 
Run install.php.



CHANGELOG:

Version 0.2 - 13.06.13

Added captcha, a few tweaks and bug fixes. Still far from finished.


Version: 0.1

It works, but features are lacking and the code is messy. Not finished.
